# MY::containers
   <p>
      This project is a recreation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
      containers - vector, stack, map, and set - with their own custom iterators.
      In addition to the containers and iterators, this project also includes
      some useful utilities like is_integral, enable_if, and iterator_traits.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The STL containers and iterators are a fundamental part of modern C++
      programming. By recreating them from scratch, this project aims to provide
      a deeper understanding of how these data structures work and how they can be
      customized to fit specific use cases. Additionally, the project introduces
      some useful utilities that can make generic programming easier and more
      efficient.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      To use this project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the root
      directory. Then, type <code>make</code> to compile the project. This will
      create a binary file named <code>main</code> in the root directory. To run
      the program, type <code>./main</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program included in this project demonstrates the usage of the vector
      container and its iterators. You can modify the program to test out the
      other containers and utilities included in the project.
    </p>
    <h2>Unit Tests</h2>
    <p>
      This project includes unit tests for each of the containers. These tests
      ensure that the containers are functioning correctly and produce the
      expected output.

    <h2>Notion Guide</h2>
    <p>
      For those who are new to STL containers or are looking for a comprehensive
      guide,i also created a Notion guide titled
      "THE ULTIMATE GUIDE to STL Containers for Dummies". This guide covers the
      basics of STL containers, their common use cases, and advanced topics like
      iterators and algorithms. You can access the guide at the following link:</br>
